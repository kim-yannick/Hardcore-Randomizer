# Hardcore Randomizer

This is going to be a randomizer for X/Y/OR/AS that should have the basic features like

- Trainer team randomization
- Wild Pokemon randomization
- Evolution randomization

And also advanced features such as

 - Random Pokemon names (shuffling and from name lists)
 - Random Pokemon stats
 - Random Attack names (shuffling and from name lists)
 - Random Attack data
 - Shuffle Pokemon sprites
 - Random text data (can make everything unreadable)
 - Randomize learnable moves
 - Scripting (create your own randomizers)

Note that this features are planned and there is nothing here at the moment. This randomizer is based on pk3DS but only includes randomization features.

Maybe I missed something here?
